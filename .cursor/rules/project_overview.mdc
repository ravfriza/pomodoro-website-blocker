# Project Overview: Pomodoro Timer Chrome Extension

This document outlines the plan for developing a Pomodoro Timer Chrome Extension.

## Core Goal
To build a minimalist, clean, and highly functional Pomodoro Timer Chrome Extension with website blocking capabilities, inspired by applications like Todoist.

## Key Features

### Pomodoro Timer
- Implements the standard Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break.
- Timer durations (focus and break) should be user-adjustable.

### Website Blocking
- While the Pomodoro timer is active (during focus sessions), the extension will block a predefined list of distracting websites.
- Default blocked websites: `youtube.com`, `twitter.com`, `facebook.com`.
- A settings panel will allow users to add or remove websites from this blocklist.

## UI/UX Requirements

- **Popup Interface**: A simple and intuitive popup UI will be displayed when the extension icon is clicked.
- **Timer Controls**: The popup will feature "Start", "Pause", and "Reset" buttons for the Pomodoro timer.
- **Settings Page**: A dedicated page for settings, which includes:
    - Blocklist editor (add/remove websites).
    - Pomodoro duration settings (focus and break lengths).

## Technical Specifications

- **Manifest Version**: The extension must use Manifest V3.
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Website blocking will be implemented using either `chrome.scripting` or `chrome.declarativeNetRequest`.
- **Data Persistence**: User preferences, including timer settings and the custom blocklist, will be persisted using `chrome.storage.sync`.
- **Deliverables**:
    - `manifest.json`
    - `popup.html`
    - `popup.js`
    - Any other necessary assets (icons, CSS files, etc.).
- The final output should include all source code files, structured in a way that is ready to be zipped and loaded directly into Chrome via `chrome://extensions`.
